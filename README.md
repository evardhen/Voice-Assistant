# Voice-Assistant

This project is work in progress. 

To get it working, one needs to install the vosk models in the correct language (https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models) and install the requirements.txt.

The language is currently set to german, as are the logging comments. The language can be changed in the config.yml and manually in the files (still needs improvement).

Currently, there are 4 intents implemented. A Wikipedia search, a time module, a reminder and and stop module.
